## Updated Portfolio Page

* Pin some repos that you want to share

  * Navigate to your [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/USERNAME?tab=repositories)

  * Click "Customize your pinned repositories"

  * Click the "Repositories you contribute to" checkbox (this will allow you to "pin" Project 1 even if you aren't the "owner")

  * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

  * Make sure each of these projects is deployed and add a link to the deployed project in their README files

#### Content

Your updated site should have the following content:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume

* List of projects. For each project make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the code on GitHub

#### Design

The content of your portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. That said, there are a couple basic requirements your portfolio page should meet:

* Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes

* Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

#### Competitive Content

* At least 3 deployed projects

* External content:

  * Update your LinkedIn with the projects you've worked on so far

  * Update the README for each project you linked to with a description of the problem,
  how you solved it, and some information about your technical approach

  * Suggested: refactor some of your code from earlier assignments to make them more readable
